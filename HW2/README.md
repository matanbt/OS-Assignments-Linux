## Description
Implementation of Linux-Shell using process-management, pipes and signals.

### Shell Functionality
* Executing commands foreground or background (using `&`).
* Piping output of one command to the input of the other one (using `|`).
* Redirecting output of a command to a text file(using `>`).

## Files
* **shell.c:** Provides a skeleton for the shell, by running infinite-loop reading the commands. 
* **myshell.c:** Implementations of the shell functionalities.
